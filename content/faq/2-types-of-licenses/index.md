question: "What types of LocalStack licenses do you offer?"
tags: ['General']
---

We currently offer three types of licenses:

1. **LocalStack Pro**: Individual User Licenses: Individual user licenses are used on the individual users local machines (they offer unlimited use of LocalStack Pro on   the individual developers local machines).

2. **LocalStack Pro - CI Licenses**: For using LocalStack Pro in CI environments and shared cloud resources you require a LocalStack Pro CI license key. Only one CI key is required and can be configured across all CI environments, but you have the option to setup different CI keys for usage tracking purposes at no additional cost. Each user triggering a build in the CI pipeline will trigger the same CI keys, therefore CI keys are usage based and independent of the number of users actually triggering the builds. The base LocalStack Pro CI package comes with 200 build credits per month across your CI keys and auto top ups upon credit consumption can be configured or disabled. The same key can be shared across multiple CI nodes and is independent of the number of users.

3. **LocalStack Enterprise Licenses**: Our advanced enterprise offering covers both individual user licenses and CI licenses, as well as advanced team collaboration and analytics features, user management, and extended enterprise support.
